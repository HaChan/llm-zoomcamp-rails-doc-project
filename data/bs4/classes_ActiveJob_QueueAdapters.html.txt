It either runs on a separate or forked process, or on a different thread.No: The job is run in the same process.QueuesYes: Jobs may set which queue they are run in with queue_as or by using the set method.DelayedYes: The adapter will run the job in the future through perform_later.(Gem): An additional gem is required to use perform_later with this adapter.No: The adapter will run jobs at the next opportunity and cannot use perform_later.N/A: The adapter does not support queuing.NOTE: queue_classic supports job scheduling since version 3.1. For older versions you can use the queue_classic-later gem.PrioritiesThe order in which jobs are processed can be configured differently depending on the adapter.Job: Any class inheriting from the adapter may set the priority on the job object relative to other jobs.Queue: The adapter can set the priority for job queues, when setting a queue with Active Job this will be respected.Yes: Allows the priority to be set on the job object, at the queue level or as default configuration option.No: The adapter does not allow the priority of jobs to be configured.N/A: The adapter does not support queuing, and therefore sorting them.TimeoutWhen a job will stop after the allotted time.Job: The timeout can be set for each instance of the job class.Queue: The timeout is set for all jobs on the queue.Global: The adapter is configured that all jobs have a maximum run time.No: The adapter does not allow the timeout of jobs to be configured.N/A: This adapter does not run in a separate process, and therefore timeout is unsupported.RetriesJob: The number of retries can be set per instance of the job class.Yes: The Number of retries can be configured globally, for each instance or on the queue. This adapter may also present failed instances of the job class that can be restarted.Global: The adapter has a global number of retries.No: The adapter does not allow the number of retries to be configured.N/A: The adapter does not run in a separate process, and therefore doesnât support retries.NamespaceCLASSActiveJob::QueueAdapters::AbstractAdapterCLASSActiveJob::QueueAdapters::AsyncAdapterCLASSActiveJob::QueueAdapters::BackburnerAdapterCLASSActiveJob::QueueAdapters::DelayedJobAdapterCLASSActiveJob::QueueAdapters::InlineAdapterCLASSActiveJob::QueueAdapters::QueueClassicAdapterCLASSActiveJob::QueueAdapters::ResqueAdapterCLASSActiveJob::QueueAdapters::SidekiqAdapterCLASSActiveJob::QueueAdapters::SneakersAdapterCLASSActiveJob::QueueAdapters::SuckerPunchAdapterCLASSActiveJob::QueueAdapters::TestAdapterMethodsLlookupClass Public methodslookup(name)LinkReturns adapter for specified name.ActiveJob::QueueAdapters.lookup(:sidekiq)
