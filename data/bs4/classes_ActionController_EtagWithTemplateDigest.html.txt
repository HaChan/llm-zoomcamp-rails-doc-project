Action Controller Etag With TemplateDigestWhen our views change, they should bubble up into HTTP cache freshness and bust browser caches. So the template digest for the current action is automatically included in the ETag.Enabled by default for apps that use Action View. Disable by settingconfig.action_controller.etag_with_template_digest = falseOverride the template to digest by passing:templatetofresh_whenandstale?calls. For example:# We're going to render widgets/show, not posts/show
fresh_when @post, template: 'widgets/show'

# We're not going to render a template, so omit it from the ETag.
fresh_when @post, template: falseIncluded ModulesActionController::ConditionalGet
