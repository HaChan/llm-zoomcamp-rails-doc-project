Action DispatchAssumeSSLWhen proxying through a load balancer that terminatesSSL, the forwarded request will appear as though itâs HTTP instead of HTTPS to the application. This makes redirects and cookie security target HTTP instead of HTTPS. This middleware makes the server assume that the proxy already terminatedSSL, and that the request really is HTTPS.MethodsCcallNnewClass Public methodsnew(app)LinkSource:show|on GitHub# File actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/assume_ssl.rb, line 14definitialize(app)@app=appendInstance Public methodscall(env)LinkSource:show|on GitHub# File actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/assume_ssl.rb, line 18defcall(env)env["HTTPS"] ="on"env["HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PORT"] ="443"env["HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO"] ="https"env["rack.url_scheme"] ="https"@app.call(env)end
