Action DispatchRequestIdMakes a unique request id available to theaction_dispatch.request_idenv variable (which is then accessible throughActionDispatch::Request#request_idor the aliasActionDispatch::Request#uuid) and sends the same id to the client via theX-Request-Idheader.The unique request id is either based on theX-Request-Idheader in the request, which would typically be generated by a firewall, load balancer, or the web server, or, if this header is not available, a random uuid. If the header is accepted from the outside world, we sanitize it to a max of 255 chars and alphanumeric and dashes only.The unique request id can be used to trace a request end-to-end and would typically end up being part of log files from multiple pieces of the stack.MethodsCcallNnewClass Public methodsnew(app, header:)LinkSource:show|on GitHub# File actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/request_id.rb, line 25definitialize(app,header:)@app=app@header=headerendInstance Public methodscall(env)LinkSource:show|on GitHub# File actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/request_id.rb, line 30defcall(env)req=ActionDispatch::Request.newenvreq.request_id=make_request_id(req.headers[@header])@app.call(env).tap{|_status,headers,_body|headers[@header] =req.request_id}end
