Raised when an unsupported argument type is set as a job argument. We currently supportString,Integer,Float,NilClass,TrueClass,FalseClass,BigDecimal,Symbol,Date,Time,DateTime,ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone,ActiveSupport::Duration,Hash,ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess,Array,Range, or GlobalID::Identification instances, although this can be extended by adding custom serializers. Raised if you set the key for aHashsomething else than a string or a symbol. Also raised when trying to serialize an object which canât be identified with a GlobalID - such as an unpersisted Active Record model.
