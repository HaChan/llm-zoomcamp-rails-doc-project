Action Controller Etag WithFlashWhen youâre using the flash, itâs generally used as a conditional on the view. This means the content of the view depends on the flash. Which in turn means that the ETag for a response should be computed with the content of the flash in mind. This does that by including the content of the flash as a component in the ETag thatâs generated for a response.Included ModulesActionController::ConditionalGet
