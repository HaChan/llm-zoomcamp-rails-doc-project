Active Storage PreviewSome non-image blobs can be previewed: that is, they can be presented as images. A video blob can be previewed by extracting its first frame, and a PDF blob can be previewed by extracting its first page.A previewer extracts a preview image from a blob. Active Storage provides previewers for videos and PDFs.ActiveStorage::Previewer::VideoPrevieweris used for videos whereasActiveStorage::Previewer::PopplerPDFPreviewerandActiveStorage::Previewer::MuPDFPreviewerare used for PDFs. Build custom previewers by subclassingActiveStorage::Previewerand implementing the requisite methods. Consult theActiveStorage::Previewerdocumentation for more details on whatâs required of previewers.To choose the previewer for a blob, Active Storage callsaccept?on each registered previewer in order. It uses the first previewer for whichaccept?returns true when given the blob. In a Rails application, add or remove previewers by manipulatingRails.application.config.active_storage.previewersin an initializer:Rails.application.config.active_storage.previewers
# => [ ActiveStorage::Previewer::PopplerPDFPreviewer, ActiveStorage::Previewer::MuPDFPreviewer, ActiveStorage::Previewer::VideoPreviewer ]

# Add a custom previewer for Microsoft Office documents:
Rails.application.config.active_storage.previewers << DOCXPreviewer
# => [ ActiveStorage::Previewer::PopplerPDFPreviewer, ActiveStorage::Previewer::MuPDFPreviewer, ActiveStorage::Previewer::VideoPreviewer, DOCXPreviewer ]Outside of a Rails application, modifyActiveStorage.previewersinstead.The built-in previewers rely on third-party system libraries. Specifically, the built-in video previewer requiresFFmpeg. Two PDF previewers are provided: one requiresPoppler, and the other requiresmuPDF(version 1.8 or newer). To preview PDFs, install either Poppler or muPDF.These libraries are not provided by Rails. You must install them yourself to use the built-in previewers. Before you install and use third-party software, make sure you understand the licensing implications of doing so.NamespaceMODULEActiveRecordMODULEActiveStorageCLASSActiveStorage::PreviewCLASSActiveStorage::Preview::UnprocessedError
