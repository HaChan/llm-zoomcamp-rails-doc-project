MethodsEetagInstance Public methodsetag(&etagger)LinkAllows you to consider additional controller-wide information when generating an ETag. For example, if you serve pages tailored depending on whoâs logged in at the moment, you may want to add the current user id to be part of the ETag to prevent unauthorized displaying of cached pages.class InvoicesController < ApplicationController
  etag { current_user&.id }

  def show
    # Etag will differ even for the same invoice when it's viewed by a different current_user
    @invoice = Invoice.find(params[:id])
    fresh_when etag: @invoice
  end
