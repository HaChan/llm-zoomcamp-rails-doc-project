Active Record TimestampActive Record automatically timestamps create and update operations if the table has fields namedcreated_at/created_onorupdated_at/updated_on.Timestamping can be turned off by setting:config.active_record.record_timestamps = falseTimestamps are in UTC by default but you can use the local timezone by setting:config.active_record.default_timezone = :localTimeZone aware attributesActive Record keeps all thedatetimeandtimecolumns timezone aware. By default, these values are stored in the database as UTC and converted back to the currentTime.zonewhen pulled from the database.This feature can be turned off completely by setting:config.active_record.time_zone_aware_attributes = falseYou can also specify that onlydatetimecolumns should be time-zone aware (whiletimeshould not) by setting:ActiveRecord::Base.time_zone_aware_types = [:datetime]You can also add database-specific timezone aware types. For example, for PostgreSQL:ActiveRecord::Base.time_zone_aware_types += [:tsrange, :tstzrange]Finally, you can indicate specific attributes of a model for which time zone conversion should not applied, for instance by setting:class Topic < ActiveRecord::Base
  self.skip_time_zone_conversion_for_attributes = [:written_on]
